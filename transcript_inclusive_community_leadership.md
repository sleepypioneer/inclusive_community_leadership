# ﻿Transcript for Inclusive Community Leadership by Jessica Greene first presented at PyCon Italia 2022


Hi everyone, I'm really excited to be here with here at Python, Italia. I hope you're enjoying the conference so far, and not getting too hot. When I got asked to come and speak, I have to say I was totally exhilarated, I mean, what an amazing opportunity to be here with you all here in Florence, but also to have this platform to raise issues that I find important, that I believe are important for us all in the Python community. When Fiorella, Patrick and Matteo asked me to speak I didn't need to think twice about what I wanted to talk about, because I've been thinking about this topic of community leadership for quite a while now, and have been reflecting upon what we can do within the community to make our leadership more inclusive.


One reason this has been kind of at the top of my mind is because as I go along my journey of being a software engineer, I'm also thinking about the tech leadership roles that we have in our professional teams and reflecting on the parallels I see between the leadership roles in companies and the leaders in the community and how one might influence the other.


To be clear, my intention is not to stand here and present a defined set of answers, because unfortunately I don't have them all, but I would like to open up some questions with you all, make some suggestions, give you some insights from my experience and hopefully start a conversation, a conversation I hope will last beyond the 45 minutes that I'm going to talk for it, spill into this conference and hopefully go beyond that.


-


What I want you to think about during this session is what does leadership look like in the community?
Who are the leaders in the community that you know, who are your role models, and what work do they do to shape how our communities look?


I then like to ask you to also think about what is inclusive leadership, what does that mean to you? How can we build that into the communities that we so dearly love thinking maybe about things that you've learned could be within the community, but could maybe be from your professional experience or maybe from somebody else that you've been working alongside.


Lastly, I'd like you to think about what professional team leaders can potentially learn from community leaders and how can we make those positions more accessible to more people and ensure different types of leadership roles and work gain the recognition they deserve.


-


Ok I've mentioned a few terms there, and I would just like to take a moment to also clarify the definition and the context in which I'm talking about.


Community: there are many types of community in our world, but I am specifically going to be discussing groups who are formed around a shared common interest and, or a goal, and where they have a voluntary participation. Most of my examples I have put into this talk come from tech communities, but some of this would be applicable to different types of voluntary communities.


-


I've also mentioned leadership. And for this discussion, we'll define this as the skill and work that has helped shape an organization or team, helping to define its mission and support the achieving of its goals.


-


And to clarify, leadership is not a role per se. Leadership is a skillset that can be practiced at any level within a framework, any role or by any member. So when we're talking about leadership as a skill set and leadership work, this is not something I'm defined as being a community organizer per say though I will reference that work quite a bit. To be honest this is something that I would actually like us to reflect on a little bit more; that potentially we miss to recognize some of the leaders in our community groups because of the lens through which we see roles in the community.


Furthermore, I'd like to also, so think about how we might incentivize more people to be involved in leadership work, what barriers they may face and how we can make our decision-making more inclusive to help us build more sustainable communities and teams.


-


From this session I am hoping you will take away with you the following: some insights from my own personal experience with leadership in the Pyladies community, conversations I have had with other members and my thoughts around that.


Secondly, I'd like you to think how, or have a reconsideration of what leaders looked like and what they do.
And I be giving us a few tips on how to make decision-making more inclusive and to make leadership roles more accessible.


And last, but certainly not least, I would like you to have the opportunity to get to know about some of the awesome community leaders that I've met and that I'm aware of, some of them, I'm sure you'll also be familiar with, but maybe some not, and let really take thi opportunity to celebrate and recognize all of the amazing work that all these different people do in that communities.


-
Okay, so its probably a good time to give you some context to who I am and why I'm bringing this topic to PyCon. I'm Jessica, I'm a software engineer at ecosia, and if you haven't heard of us, we’re the search engine for a better planet. However five years ago,  you would have found me roasting coffee or pouring hearts and leaves and into milk for lattes, and, 10 years ago, you would have found me running around film sets, changing batteries, organizing camera equipment, and putting tiny bit of tape at actors feet. 


So while I'm relatively new to the tech sector, I have been involved in various community groups and as someone with no formal training in tech actually define myself as a self-taught slash community taught developer and in the full ethos off that spirit, that's not actually a phrase that I coined myself. I first heard this from a wonderful member of the community: Daniel Ross, in a talk that he gave to Django girls Berlin when I was first starting out.


This talk has absolutely been community driven. Drawing from many of the folks I've met and seen talk within the community, I'll be referencing them along the way and I reccomend following their social accounts.


You'll also find my slides if you follow this link. And I also have a full transcript of slightly previous version of the talk there for folks who require it or prefer to engage with content in that way.

This year I am celebrating five years in the Python community. I first joined in autumn 2017, when I joined my first PyLadies meetup. Shortly after this, I became a community organizer, signing up to support setting up events, handling community emails, corresponding with potential speakers and hosts, contributing to our website and responding to people's messages on slack.


I've also given a number of talks, run workshops, mentored other community members. And most recently I've been supporting other Pyladies is to do these things themselves.


-


So I’ve mentioned them a few times now and while I think many of you here will already be familiar with PyLadies I dont see any reason to not talk more about what they do and give them the recognition they deserve. PyLadies was founcded in 2011 by these 7 women. Their mission was to diversify the python community through the three pillars of education, conference, and outreach. Motivated by a desire to find like-minded individuals to converse with and for the empowerment that having folks that look like you represented brings


-


Fast forward over ten years and there are chapters around the world with this mission, focusing on helping more women become active participants and leaders in the Python open-source community. And for clarity anyone can join this mission and participate, assuming you abide by their code of conduct. I would like to say a huge thanks to all the people involved with PyLadies because as you will see I have gained so much from the community and continue to see the amazing work being done in parallel and to compliment the work of the broader Python community.


-


Ok you know a little bit about where I have come from, now I want to tell you about how I started in this community. And I ask you to also think back to when you first got involved in the Python community, perhaps it was a long ago, perhaps it is today.


This event on the left, this is the first one I attended. It was a hands-on workshop doing data analysis with pandas, led by someone. I think many of you in the room will know, for the various contributions that he's made to the Python community and this Christine Bara. For me, this was eye opening. I could not believe  I could go somewhere, meet other people, get free education, have a slice of pizza and get a beer! I mean bellisimo, right?!


I'd stumbled across this by total chance while searching python classes in Berlin, and I knew instantly that this was just a great space for me. However not coming from a traditional background though. I honestly really struggled at some early meetups. I often couldn't get the installation to work, understand the terms being used or found myself by the end of the evening, having only just got the supply Jupiter notebook running while everyone else was already wrapping up the solutions I didn't give up because I saw all these other women around me and they were doing this. I knew that if I kept in, it kept going, I would also be able to get there.


I asked around shyly if folks could help me. And honestly, I was overwhelmed by the openness to me, shortcuts helped me deep book on my machine, give side explanations to what we were using or share resources. I felt a sense of belonging that I had yet to feel at the non-women-focused meetups I attended, that honestly, I had yet to feel in most of the spaces I occupied.


At another early meetup I attended PyLadies were running a tutorial for MicroPython with Christine (pictured here in the middle) another member, Zissi, pictured here right sat down next to me, first asking if the place was free. I was memorised as this person, who has since become a dear colleague and friend ignored completely the supplied tutorial and instead proceeded to use her creativity and knowledge to create her own unique program. It was this experience along with many others which gave me an appreciation and love for this community, it’s members and the space they had created.


I remember feeling immense respect for Agata and Mei li pictured on the left who were running these events. And when they asked for folks to get involved though first intimidating I decided to put myself forward.


-




So who here has also potentially had some involvement in community organization. Like it could have been for a single event, a regular caring me, uh, or a conference, maybe some other kind of event.


Okay. Few, few people. Yay. Good on all of you. So you probably all have some stories about how things don't always go to plan, perhaps the food didn't turn up, perhaps the speaker fell ill location canceled on you last minute? Sound familiar. Yeah. So as I mentioned, I became an organizer shortly after I joined PyLadies and for the first event I ever led the organization for our hosts had kindly agreed to sponsor food. And you probably can guess which type of food everyone's favorite (well at least in Berlin) …pizza. So I was super proud not just to have secured a location for the event, but also food and drink for free, um, or sponsored for all of the people that would attend.


The meetup page had just over 60 attendees, but the other organizers had warned me that number might not represent the true number of folks who would turn up, probably expect less. Nonetheless, I was so keen, so proud that I got all of this and I wanted to make sure there was enough pizza for everybody who was coming after work to this meetup.


I confidently said to the host yes, go ahead, order pizza for 40 to 50 people. Well, you might've guessed that not even half that amount came. This was a lesson, a slightly awkward one but a lesson. Very fortunately, no one really takes, say no to being able to take free pizza home. 


The point being though is we learn a lot of organizers and we see a lot of the behind the scenes work that takes place to create not only these events, but also the safe spaces that they're there to provide.


We hear from other members the impact this work has on their lives, both at a personal level and professionally. And for me, at least that's what really drives me to continue supporting these efforts however, I would argue some tangible benefits to being a community organizer.


-


The predominant one for me would be visibly as an organizer. I found myself talking with companies on a more level playing field and that they took a more active interest in me because they saw how involved I was in the community.
I found myself with more social media followers and being asked to participate in other communities or conferences. I've been asked to speak at quite a number of conferences including this one.


And I'm really grateful for the opportunity that that gives me to have a platform where I can take where I can raise awareness and talk about what's important to me and put a focus on the topics I think we should be actively tackling.


Of course it's a lot of work to be so actively involved in the community, and we have to recognize the effort and the time required to do it, but there are these tangible benefits that, and opportunities that as someone who's very prominent in the community, you do tend to get.


- 


When I started, I threw myself into being an organizer. I was trying to think of new content, new format, how could we support more people, not just to get into the industry, but to advance and thrive. I would meet all of these different people in the community that were just brilliant, but often not finding the right opportunities for them, or looking for that bit more support to be able to get to where they want it to be. I really felt like our community would be able to provide that support. 


Berlin PyLadies was, co-founded in 2013 by Mei Li who was in the picture before. By the time I joined it already built a community with regular meetups and quite a large following a meetup.com. They had already had some organizers come and go, so I really benefitted a lot from all of that previous work that had already been done to kind of build this community andI got the opportunity to learn from Mei Li and the others that were there at the time.


-


However after close to two years of actively being in organized, I actually felt I needed a break and I decided to step down. It was consequently also actually the time when mainly, um, who has mentioned was the founder of our chapter and have been doing organizing for the past six years, had also decided to pass on the gauntlet. We had a few new organizers who'd recently joined. So we didn't doubt everything was going to keep running, as it did. During our final meet up together, where we talked about the experience in the group so far, what we had learned and what we had achieved during this time. At the end, a long running member, Maria Jose, who is also a role model of mine, presented Mei li and myself with these code related books and thanked us for the hard work. This made me so happy and sad at the same time to be stepping down, for me, it's always been about hearing and seeing this impact that you can have on others by being transparent, by vocalizing your own experience and actively creating spaces where different voices and experiences could be heard.


So I stepped back and it was only after really doing so that I had chance to reflect on what old being an organizer had meant, and what were the potential barriers to other folks from receiving the similar recognition that we did. And it also got me thinking about, were there other ways that we could make our leadership more inclusive in such that more folks would be able to participate and voice their opinions to influence the direction of our community?


-


First I thought about who are the leaders in our community, who was shaping the Python community and what it meant to do so. I thought about some of the leaders I admire such as Naomi Ceder, Tereza Iofciu and Cheuk Ting Ho.


Secondly I thought about what are the kind of leadership work is happening that perhaps doesn't receive the same visibility or high profile, but also steers the direction our community is going in.


When I signed up to be an organizer, The organisers at the time Mei Li and Agata had asked at the meetup I attended for folks to support but I didn’t feel it was something I could get involved in, I only knew at this point about 10 lines of python. They asked again the following meetup and I decided to go ask them, after all, I had the time as I had quit my job to follow the pursuit of becoming a programmer. It turned out having time was really the only qualifier. Even still in those first months I was totally unsure about what I should be doing, and what  initiatives I could do, like take my own.


-


There's lots of different ways that you can get involved in the community that can help shape it’s direction and this list is by no means comprehensive.


Firstly you might choose to participate in surveys and polls to give feedback on things that you're enjoying about different events or the group as a whole.


It could be that you support other members by answering their questions in slack, or you offer to be a coach or a mentor to the members.


You might take participant in event organization, helping to run maybe a single event, or a series of events.


You might contribute to the website that the community has.


And then there's also a lot of smaller jobs such as the email correspondence and social media, which a little happy, little bit more frequently, but don't always take up a lot of time.


You may also find something the community doesn’t know it need, for example a member of our Berlin chapter Cristian has just made us a techno count down to play at the start of our streams because he felt the default streamyard one we were using didn’t showcase us well enough!


-


But there are also barriers to getting more involved that we might not always see. Beyond that initial imposter syndrome I would like to propose that time is a large barrier for folks getting involved, especially when we're talking about using it for essentially unpaid labor.


On average, I spend about four hours a week in community work. That's a good week. Sometimes it's more, so this is normally though broken up into 15 to 30 minute chunks and it kind of has to be because I can't control when someone's going to respond. For me, that's actually not too difficult to fit into my day to day. Fortunately to start with my workplace is supportive and allow me to take time during the day for community work. Which I think is something we definitely need to normalize a little bit more with all companies. So if you are in a position where you can make that a standard in the company, I highly encourage you to do so.


-


Many folks tell us is they'd like to get more involved, but they would like someone to also help guide them through that process. When I joined the current organizers, mainly an architect had taken time to talk through that with me, how they approach things and we ran a number of meetups together so I could get feel for it was involved


Later when other members would join, we'd have the new person shadow someone else, at least for the first meetup, so they never felt alone while they were starting out. 


-


As I mentioned, when I started out, I was also pretty unsure about what I could and couldn't do or better put like what I shouldn't be doing and in a community like ours, to be honest, it's normally do what you want and are prepared to put your time into. So that's great, but that lack of structure is not really helpful for folks who are joining, especially if they're short on time and want to just get on with it. So it got me thinking about how we can make our processes simpler, to understand and to do, but not restrictive so that more folks can get involved in the leadership activities that they want to.


So this year we've started to see how we can automate things a bit more and document them so we can make onboarding easier and tasks, less time consuming.
Yeah. One to explain and secondly, for people to do.


We already had quite a lot of documentation in our GitHub repository, thanks to a lot of work done by Mei Li, Agata  and some other members. The problem was that people didn't know where it was. So we would still see in surveys, people saying, oh, it'd be great if you have this, and we're thinking we do have that.


This year we have therefore added different workflows to our slack channels, that get prompted when a new member joins and tells them where they can find what resources we guides their introduction. We also added something similar for people who want to organize events, where they can use a workflow to be able to create a suggestion program and get feedback on it, and we can then match them with other organizers and the host company.


-


On top of these I think something that holds folks back from getting involved in understanding the impact your work's having. This is really important for motivation to keep you going and helps you to understand when you need to kind of change things.


For a long time now we've issued a short anonymous survey to our members at the end of every meetup to check in if they feel the space is safe and meeting their needs.


-


One point to stress though is while those things might help some new organizers and from my experience, they would be quite useful. Everybody is unique. So we need to ensure our processes and definitions here are not too restrictive. And they allow flexibility to change over time and to adapt to the people who are participating, um, when we need to allow for different types of leadership or personalities to fill these roles.


As Pat Kua tells us in this tweet, when a flower doesn't bloom, we fix the environment in which it grows, not the flower, and also not all flowers were thriving in the same environment. Similarly, we already are maybe occupying these spaces. So we've defined what that looks like around us, but we need to ensure that we are not doing that in a way that new people can't join and we need to make sure that we're open to change so that we can accommodate others, ways of working.


-


Representation is really important when we start to talk about leadership and who are the visible leaders within a group. Reports such as this one by McKinsey have proven that it boosts productivity and that the greater the representation, the higher, the likelihood of performance.


PyLadies was created because of this very lack of representation, and so few women being visible in the Python community at the time. But as a open source community that also believes in intersectional feminism, we have to also ask our selves tough questions and wonder if we are doing enough to serve all members of our community. Just because we a group focused on empowering and underrepresented folks in tech, that doesn't mean that we're inherently inclusive and diverse. We too must put in the work, to ensure that we are creating a safe space, not just for ourselves, but also for our most margonalised members.


If I want to say this simple, as someone who's presenting as a white, cis, heterosexual and neuro-typical woman, I can not know what other members of our community need, especially those who hold less privilege than I do. I personally really believe this requires us to bubble up the most marginalized voices to the top. And when he should do that through supporting them, making things, uh, therefore better for everybody, but we really to do this, we have to make the space more accessible and the effort worth it 


-


One model we might look at is the PyLadies global council. Formed after a 2019 meeting during PyCon it was formed to support all the chapters and try tackle some of the common problems being faced.


The Global Council has 9 seats, including 6 seats selected by public election with a 2 year service commitment and 3 seats selected by application with a 1 year service commitment. Additionally the Council has a diversity and inclusion requirement that sets a maximum of 3 seats to be filled by members from the same counry of residence.


These are mechanisms that ensure the space is there for new ideas, that more people have the opportunity to participate and that new council members need to be found to keep the community sustainable.


At a local level, this is a lot less structured, but by encouraging new members to join as organizers, it also gives the space for others to step back and for rotation to happen. I truly believe it's helpful, not only for the individuals, because community burnout is absolutely a thing that also deserves more awareness, but also for the community as a whole. And sometimes that's hard because sometimes that means letting go. Even if there's no one new to take over you have to accept  the events might just not happen until the next person stands up. This is really part of what being a sustainable community means. 




-


And it's not only being representation within leadership that will help us build more sustainable communities. We also need to ensure we're including members more and giving different ways to provide input. So we have a space where new ideas, new voices can come. Even if it's not from folks who are predominantly doing this leadership work. 


Anil dash says in his article, the old boys club is for losers:
Those who are reaching out to include all members of their community, who are seeking out new ideas and voices are not only winning.
They're the only ones who will continue to win. 


We need to be more proactive in reaching out beyond the immediate folks in our community and find out how we can support folks more and where we can find new members.


-


Now I think there are many arguments why being more inclusive pays off and that’s always a great motivator, that facebook, google or twitter are doing it means it’s the trendy thing to do.


But this is also the right thing to do. We're too often in this mindset that doing something has to give us a payoff. And while often that is a consequence, we also need to be comfortable with challenging what sets the standard, the percieved social norm or expected.


The discussion around whether women or other gender minorities should be in tech is not new, but we still find ourselves fighting old stereotypes, having the additional work of making space for ourselves and our voices heard.


As an industry, we've seen this in our products as well as our work places: we've seen the bias we've built into AI, unequal working conditions that value some people more over others, the discrimination and oppression that's caused by not taking a more active stance and breaking down structures, which are not only outdated, but just outright harmful.


So let's not do this only because there's a payoff. Let's do this to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to be here.


-


One thing we can work towards is building better frameworks for inclusive decision-making. One that's transparent, and clear in the requirements.


This doesn't mean every decision requires a complete group consensus, but community members should have visibility on what decisions being made and how they can participate. We do need to update the rest of the community when a decision has been made, especially if it has an impact on them.


If the stakes are higher, for example, when funding is involved, then it's really important to ensure that multiple perspectives have been considered so that the outcomes, the best for the community as a whole, this won't always mean everyone's satisfied or gets the outcome they desire, but the decision will have been made fairly with as many folks input as possible to build a representative and informed decision.


So how can we achieve this? Well, I'd like to propose a few ideas I've been working on with other at PyLadies Berlin, it’s not complete and I'd love to hear if you have tried any of these or something similar or perhaps you also have additional ones that you think we can add.


-


Decision making needs to be accessible, we have to ensure that we're not gatekeeping by restricting who has access to things such as contacts, funding, accounts, and opportunities. Of course we're technologist we are going to have to do this with privacy and security in mind but there is tooling to help us. fashion, because we don't want to expose sensitive information about community members or, um, our sponsors.




-


Similarly we need to make sure decisions are made transparent, so anyone in the community can also observe the process behind it. One thing that we've started to do lately is to have regular open leadership meetings and as this meeting is really about deciding where the community is going, we decided it should be possible for any member to join and give their input.


In a similar way we recently started to move conversations out of a pirate organiser channel we had and into public channels. This allows for folks to observe what is going on and join the conversation when they feel comfortable. While the private channel may have been more direct and quicker the pay off of having a public channel is well worth it.


-


Representative, as I've already mentioned we don't want to get in the situation where we're making decisions for other community members without having their perspective in mind. That might require us to go out and proactively speak to specific community members or to do more surveys. We need to ask ourselves how can we get peopl who are, not currently represented in our leadership team to have the same opportunities and to be able to see themselves in the leaders of our community?


-


This leads me back to recognition which Ive also mentioned, and ensuring that community leadership work is seen and praised. To do so we need to build a culture of giving kudos and being vocal about how grateful we are for our other community members, this might be tweeting about some help you recently received, giving kudos in a community channel for the work someone has done or taking the time to go through that article someone shared and give it the asked for feedback.


-


And with all the fore mentioned in place we also need to have space for innovation, the flexibility for new ideas and formats. We need to refrain from answers like, well, we haven't done it like that before, or it might not work like that and instead take a moment to reflect and think if there's actually maybe a way to allow for that idea to happen, even if the learning will be that it’s easier another way but not leaning into the trope of making everyone learn the hard way. I think there's a lot of space for us to be able to be a little bit more flexible, try new formats, try new ideas.
They might not be successful. That doesn't matter. What matters is that we really, um, give the space and we create somewhere where people can be creative and a turf.


-


So now that I've given a few ideas around how we might make these things in the community more inclusive and how we might recognize leadership work in the community more, I'd like to, before I wrap up tie this back to what I mentioned at the start, which was how can this potentially influence our tech teams in the industry.


In parallel to all the work Ive been doing in the community and I'll define it as that, not to diminish the joy it gives me, but to recognize the time and effort it requires, I've also been progressing as an engineer and learning about typical growth trajectories.


In particular, we recently did a lot of work at Ecosia to defin the role of the tech lead. The reason we did this was because it was raised by an engineer that while we have gender parity within the engineering team, which is pretty amazing, to be honest, and equally depressing that I have to point that out, this was not reflected in the tech lead group at all, and those are the folks who predominantly involved in decision-making. 


-


And it turns out that we're not the only people who apparently have faced this problem. Less than 10% of startups in the world are owned by or led by women, and despite that there is an upward trend of women in leadership roles. Only 25% of women are confident that they could be promoted to executive management in their company.


If we take a look at this in an intersectional manner, we see this even more dire. Black women only make 18% of entry level roles in tech compared to 30% for white women.


-


This discussion at Ecosia led us to do quite a lot of training around leadership, including one run by Pat Kua, who I quoted earlier. So we started to think about what  the qualities of leaders are, and what I found interesting is that alot of the profil was people I already knew in the community but they don’t hold these jobs professionally. Something i have seen is that a lot (but of course not all) of the people that occupy tech lead positions tend to have gotten there based on how long they have been working as an engineer. I also saw that the expectations for these roles seem to be vague when it comes to the technical skills required and the definition fitted to match the engineers already existing in the team. This makes its a little harder for folks to push back against how these roles are perceived to be. For example if someone is working part time because their a care giver, can they still be a lead? Surely the answer is yes but there seems to be a perception that a lead should be readily available on demand.


Community leaders can not lean on a position of power, they really require buy-in from their members. If we are also under represented or margonalised ourselves we have to carry the additional mental load of this on top of being leaders in our communities or teams. 


So when we want to grow new leaders we have to do so in a equitable fashion, taking note of the barriers or perception that someone might not meet our current definition and ensure we make space for these roles to be filled by different people and the benefits that come with them to be open to all.

So before I wrap up I want to leave you with a few ideas on how to encourage new folks in your team to try out leadership roles or work.


Co-leading or splitting a role can allow someone with less time to be involved or remove some of the pressure. A set rotation also helps ensure that there will be space for fresh voices and ideas. 


Try see if you can first define the role as you have it and then question if you can redefine it to reduce barries.


Mentor others so they can get first hand experience and potentially be your replacement when your tenure is over.

Leadership is a trained skill. It's not about tenure and a role. So training folks new to the role and continuing to train them is important, especially in an industry that is still young and has hyper growth.

Lastly again we have to make the effort worth it. A few of the women that I've spoke to who hesitated around if they would want to take over a tech lead role, told me that previous bad experiences around decision making, where they were ignore or spoken over made them not want the additional overhead of such a role. If you aren`t affected by the microagressions, societal stereotypes or discrimination intentional or not then it may be hard to see why this holds folks back so it’s important to actively listen to people in your team, community and the broader industry who are willing to also put in the work to share those experiences and shed light on this. We then need to make sure we incentivise, reward and recognise that with the additional work considered.

So a very short summary of this talk, if I boil it down would be that I encourage you all to challenge the current structures, listen actively and amplify the voices of others, especially those who are margonalised. Lets look to our communities and other communities to build stronger and more sustainable teams and give recognition to those who do this work in our communities.

I mentioned at the start this was a community driven and supported talk to the next slides are to say thank you to the many folks who helped me with this talk and beyond that have helped me in the community and my career progression. As I give the space to highlighting them I encourage you to think about who you want to thank.


Lastly thank you PyCon italia, to Fiorella, Patrick and Matteo for putting their faith in me, to all the people involved in putting on such a great conference and to all of you who are here for making this space as awesome as it is.
